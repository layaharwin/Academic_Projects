% PICKACTIONB.m - Pick actions given the current state.
% 
% This function will return an action decided to be taken. It may not
% choose the best one since it is an e-greedy algorithm.
%
% You can do with this code whatever you want. The main purpose is help
% people learning about this. Also, there is no warranty of any kind.

% @param currentState: current state from which actions will be explored
% and chosen.
% @param hMdt: horizontal maze walls, part of the maze's configuration.
% @param hMlr: vertical maze walls, part of the maze's configuration.
% @param Q: matrix containing Q values.
% @param eps: epsilon value, how likely it is to choose a random option.
% @return selectedAction: action (and its corresponding Q value) that has
% been selected.
